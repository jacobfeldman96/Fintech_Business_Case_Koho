* Name: KOHO Financial Inc.
* When was the company incorporated? 
Koho Financial Inc. was founded in December 2014 
* Who are the founders of the company? 
Daniel Eberhard is the founder .
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
This company came about as a solution to lessen/remove the extremly high fees that Canadians are charged by domestic banks.

## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
The exorbitant account fees that Canadians are charged by the six large retail banks: RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC and the National Bank of Canada.
* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 
The intended customer are millenials and Gen X'ers. As of the 2016 census, millenials account for roughly 27% of Canada's population = approx 9.88 M people. Gen X'ers account for roughly 5.95 M people = aprox 17% of the population. Together they equal roughly 44% of the total population. There are currently approximately >170 000 Koho Fin customers. The Canadian commericial banking industry accounts for approximately 3.3% of GDP which is approximately $56 billion annually. Koho's current revenue is approximately $13.4 million annually. Koho's market share accounts for roughly 0.02% of the industry with potential to increase hypothetically to 44% of the industry, assuming all Millenials/Gen X'ers begin using the app on a regular basis. 
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 
The unfair advantage is that this company is domestic and focuses exclusively on the Canadian market. Competitors like Revolut are just breaking into the Canadian market and are primarily focused in Europe. Additionally, this is one of the few prepaid cash apps that provides cashback on purchases. Revolut focuses almost exclusively on travel perks for their premium subscribers.
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) 
Koho.ca uses Cart Functionaly for eCommerce. jQuery Canadian for Content Delivery Network and jQuery 2.2.4 for JavaScript Libraries. The app uses Braze for Analytics and Tracking, Angular for Frameworks, Amazon S3 for Content Delivery Network, and localForage/Moment JS for their Javascript Libraries. For payment they use Visa.
